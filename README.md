> The ruler of Limbo, Immortus bartered with the near-omnipotent Time-Keepers for immortality, in exchange becoming their agent in preserving timelines at all costs, no matter how many lives get disrupted, ruined, or erased.

### What Immortus do?

`Immortus` tracks ActiveJob job's status by employing a tracking strategy based on ActiveJob callbacks and lets you handle it on your UI through Javascript.

You can use one of our pre-implemented tracking strategies or create your own.

Currently `Immortus` uses Long Polling to verify job status. Web Sockets support is on the [ROADMAP](./docs/ROADMAP.md).

### When should I use Immortus

When you need to keep track of an async job.
For example:

- send emails
- upload / process an image
- import / export files ( .xls, .csv, ... )
- etc.

### Requirements

- Rails ( >= 4.0 )
- ActiveJob ( add `gem 'activejob_backport'` to Gemfile if 4.0 <= Rails < 4.2 )
- jQuery

#### Installation

Add to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'immortus'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

### Tracking Strategy

Immortus will use a tracking strategy to keep track of the job status.

1. If the Job has defined an [Inline Tracking Strategy](./docs/tracking_strategies.md#inline-tracking-strategy) it will use it.
2. If not it will use the [User Global Configured](./docs/tracking_strategies.md#user-global-configured) if defined
3. Otherwise it will [inferred from the ActiveJob Queue Adapter](./docs/tracking_strategies.md#inferred-from-the-activejob-queue-adapter)

You can see how this work in more detail [here](./docs/tracking_strategies.md)

### Example usage

Let's say we want to:

* Create an Invoice by AJAX
* Invoice will be created asynchronously because it's a long running task
* Notify in the UI when that invoice was created.

```javascript
// Require Immortus in your Manifest ( make sure jQuery is included at this point ):

//= ...
//= require immortus
```

```javascript
$('.create-invoice-form').on('submit', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();

  var jobFinished = function(data) { console.log(data.job_id + ' finished successfully.'); }
  var jobFailed = function(data) { console.log('error in job ' + data.job_id); }

  Immortus.create('/generate_invoice')
          .done(function (data) {
            return Immortus.verify({ jobId: data.job_id })
                           .then(jobFinished, jobFailed);
          });
});
```

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Add the routes for the job creation and check status
  immortus_jobs do
    post 'generate_invoice', to: 'invoices#generate'
  end
end

# app/controllers/invoices_controller.rb
class InvoicesController < ApplicationController
  def generate
    job = GenerateInvoiceJob.perform_later
    render_immortus(job)
  end
end

# app/jobs/generate_invoice_job.rb
class GenerateInvoiceJob < ActiveJob::Base
  # Include Immortus::Job in your new or existing ActiveJob class
  include Immortus::Job

  def perform(*args)
    # ...
  end
end
```

### Full documentation

For a full documentation on how this works please check:

* [Javascript](./docs/full.md#javascript)
* [Routes](./docs/full.md#routes)
* [Controller](./docs/full.md#controller)
* [Immortus::Job](./docs/full.md#immortus-job)

### Some more advanced examples

By allowing [custom strategies](./docs/tracking_strategies.md#custom) and [custom verify controllers](./docs/full.md#controller) Immortus can be used for more complex work. Just a few examples:

* [Track a job progress and update percentage in the UI](./docs/examples/job_progress.md)
* [Minimalistic](./docs/examples/minimalistic.md) ( more syntactic sugar / hidden behavior ) - we assume you already have jobs created and just need to know when they finish and just want to change the minimum possible
* [Intermediate](./docs/examples/intermediate.md) - we assume you will create a new background job with an extra field (percentage)
* [Explicit](./docs/examples/explicit.md) ( clear as water ) - have full control on what is going on doing the same as Intermediate way
* TODO: Add more examples here
