> The ruler of Limbo, Immortus bartered with the near-omnipotent Time-Keepers for immortality, in exchange becoming their agent in preserving timelines at all costs, no matter how many lives get disrupted, ruined, or erased.

### What Immortus do?

Immortus tracks ActiveJob job's status by employing a tracking strategy based on ActiveJob callbacks and lets you handle it on your UI through Javascript.

You can use one of our pre-implemented tracking strategy or create your own.

### When should I use Immortus

When you need to keep track of an async job. For example:

- send emails
- upload an image
- process an image
- import / export files ( .xls, .csv, ... )
- etc.

### Requirements

- Rails ( >= 4.0 )
- ActiveJob

  - `gem 'activejob'` if rails >= 4.2
  - `gem 'activejob_backport'` and it's initializer if rails >= 4.0 and < 4.2
- jQuery

### Installation

Add to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'immortus'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

### Usage Example

##### Create job routes

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  immortus_jobs do
    post "generate_invoice", :to => "invoices#generate", :as => :generate_invoice
    # other routes to jobs may be added here

    # this will create under the hood
      # get '/immortus/verify/:job_id', :to => 'immortus#verify_job', :as => :verify_immortus_job
      # post '/generate_invoice', :to => 'invoices#generate', :as => :generate_invoice
      # other routes to jobs
  end
end
```

##### Controller

```ruby
# app/controllers/invoices_controller.rb
class InvoicesController < ApplicationController
  def generate
    job = GenerateInvoiceJob.perform_later
    render_immortus job

    # this will create under the hood
    #   if job.try('job_id')
    #     render json: { job_id: job.job_id }
    #   else
    #     render json: { error: "An error occurred enqueing the job. #{job.error_exception}" }, status: 500
    #   end
  end
end
```

##### Switch Job parent class from `ActiveJob` to `Immortus::Job`

```ruby
# app/jobs/generate_invoice_job.rb
class GenerateInvoiceJob < ActiveJob
  def perform(record)
    # Generate invoices ...
  end
end
```

to

```ruby
# app/jobs/generate_invoice_job.rb
class GenerateInvoiceJob < Immortus::Job
  def perform(record)
    # Generate invoices ...
  end
end
```

##### Javascript

Require Immortus in your manifest file ( make sure jQuery is included at this point ):

```javascript
// in your main js file: usually assets/javascript/application.js

//= ...
//= require immortus
```

Call it on your JS wherever you like:

```javascript
var logBeforeSend = function() { console.log('executed before AJAX request'); }
var logAfterEnqueue = function(job_id, enqueue_successfull) { console.log('job was enqueued'); }
var logCompleted = function(job_id, successfull) { console.log('job ' + job_id + 'was finished with ' + (successfull ? 'success' : 'error'); }
}

Immortus.perform({
  url: '/generate_invoice',
  longpolling: {
    interval: 1000
  },
  beforeSend: logBeforeSend,
  afterEnqueue: logAfterEnqueue,
  completed: logCompleted
});
```

### Tracking Strategy

Immortus will use a strategy to keep track of the job status

#### Inferred from ActiveJob queue adapter

By default it will infer the strategy from the ActiveJob queue adapter ( config.active_job.adapter )

Here is a list of the ActiveJob queue adapter and its mapped strategies:

| ActiveJob QueueAdapter |    Inferred Strategy    |                         Wiki                        |
|-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|
|           :delayed_job | :delayed\_job\_strategy | [How it works?](http://www.runtime-revolution.com/) |
|            :backburner |           N/A           |                         N/A                         |

|                   :que |           N/A           |                         N/A                         |

|                :inline |           N/A           |                         N/A                         |
|                  :test |           N/A           |                         N/A                         |

###

#### Override the default strategy

```ruby
# config/initializer/immortus.rb
Immortus::Job.tracking\_strategy = :redis\_pub\_sub\_strategy
```

#### Define your own tracking strategy

```ruby
# app/jobs/tracking_strategy/my_custom_tracking_strategy.rb
module TrackingStrategy
  class MyCustomTrackingStrategy
    def find(job_id)
      MyCustomTrackingJobTable.find_by(job_id: job_id)
    end

    def job_enqueued(job_id)
      # Save somewhere that this job was created
      MyCustomTrackingJobTable.create! job_id: job_id, status: 'created'
    end

    def job_started(job_id)
      find(job_id).update_attributes(status: 'started')
    end

    def status(job_id)
      # Ensure you return one of 4 status
      # :created => 'Job was created but wasnt started yet'
      # :started => 'Job was started'
      # :finished_error => 'An error occurred running the job'
      # :finished_success => 'Job was finished'

      tracker = find(job_id)
      tracker.status.to_sym
    end

    def job_finished(job_id)
      tracker = find(job_id)
      tracker.destroy
    end
  end
end

# config/initializer/immortus.rb
Immortus::Job.tracking\_strategy = :my\_custom\_tracking\_strategy
# you could also specify the class, it's mandatory if namespaced, like:
# Immortus::Job.tracking\_strategy = TrackingStrategy::MyCustomTrackingStrategy
```
