![Immortus](./docs/Immortus.jpg)

> The ruler of Limbo, Immortus bartered with the near-omnipotent Time-Keepers for immortality, in exchange becoming their agent in preserving timelines at all costs, no matter how many lives get disrupted, ruined, or erased.

### What does Immortus do

`Immortus` tracks ActiveJob jobs statuses and lets you handle them on your UI through Javascript callbacks.

Currently `Immortus` uses Long Polling to verify job status. Web Sockets support is on the [ROADMAP](./docs/ROADMAP.md).

### When should I use Immortus

When you need to keep track of an async job.
For example:

- send emails
- upload / process an image
- import / export files ( .xls, .csv, ... )
- etc.

### How does Immortus work

`Immortus` will use a tracking strategy, based on ActiveJob callbacks, to keep track of the jobs statuses.

By default, tracking strategy will be inferred from ActiveJob Queue Adapter, but we know that you may need more complexity so we let you create your own!

You can see how tracking strategies work in more detail [here](./docs/full.md#tracking-strategy)

### Requirements

- Rails ( >= 4.0 )
- ActiveJob ( add `gem 'activejob_backport'` to Gemfile if 4.0 <= Rails < 4.2 )
- jQuery

### Installation

Add to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'immortus'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

### Example usage

##### Setup

```javascript
// Require Immortus in your Manifest ( make sure jQuery is included at this point ):

//= ...
//= require immortus
```

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Add the route to default verify
  # this is usually used with a block containing all job creation routes
  immortus_jobs
end
```

##### Track an Invoice job and then notify the UI when finished

```javascript
$('.js-track-invoice').each(function() {
  Immortus.verify({ job_id: $(this).data('job-id') })
          .then(function(data) { console.log(data.job_id + ' finished successfully.'); });
});
```

```ruby
# app/jobs/generate_invoice_job.rb
class GenerateInvoiceJob < ActiveJob::Base
  # Include Immortus::Job in your new or existing ActiveJob class
  include Immortus::Job

  def perform(*args)
    # ...
  end
end
```

##### Create an Invoice job and then notify the UI when finished

```javascript
$('.js-create-invoice').click(function() {
  Immortus.create('/generate_invoice')
          .then(function (jobInfo) {
            return Immortus.verify({ job_id: jobInfo.job_id })
                           .then(function(data) { console.log(data.job_id + ' finished successfully.'); });
          });
});
```

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Change routes DSL to receive a block for the job creation
  immortus_jobs do
    post 'generate_invoice', to: 'invoices#generate'
  end
end

# app/controllers/invoices_controller.rb
class InvoicesController < ApplicationController
  def generate
    job = GenerateInvoiceJob.perform_later
    render_immortus(job)
  end
end

# app/jobs/generate_invoice_job.rb
class GenerateInvoiceJob < ActiveJob::Base
  # Include Immortus::Job in your new or existing ActiveJob class
  include Immortus::Job

  def perform(*args)
    # ...
  end
end
```

### Full documentation

For a full documentation on how this works please check:

* [Javascript](./docs/full.md#javascript)
* [Routes](./docs/full.md#routes)
* [Controller](./docs/full.md#controller)
* [Immortus::Job](./docs/full.md#immortus-job)

### Some more advanced examples

By allowing [custom strategies](./docs/full.md#define-a-custom-tracking-strategy) and [custom verify controllers](./docs/full.md#how-to-create-a-custom-verify) `Immortus` can be used for more complex work. Just a few examples:

* [Create a Job and track progress](./docs/examples/intermediate.md)
* [Create a Job and track progress with custom verify](./docs/examples/explicit.md)
* [Track a job progress and update percentage in the UI](./docs/examples/job_progress.md)
* TODO: Add more examples here
